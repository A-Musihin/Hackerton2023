Feedback for our problem definition - DIY Problem Definition Table: 

Feedback from Group 9 to Group 6:
- problem affects quality of education, which is good
- phrase the last argument of row 3 differently - a non flexible curriculum forces people to sleep in a forced time frame
- last two questions are not answered correctly - instead aim for mentioning the gains of a good sleep
- a different approach on this topic might be the mental health of students affecting sleep and thus quality of education

Feedback from Group 2 to Group 6 (roughly translated):
- Very interessting approach, we can understand the problem.
- Bullet-Point from the fifth question: Your problem finding is a consequence of the problem rather than a new consideration.
- We didn't fully understand how parents are affected when it comes to students.
- Have you already thought about how the soultion can be technically implemented?
