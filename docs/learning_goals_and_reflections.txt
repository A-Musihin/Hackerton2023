Julian (IT2o):
Personal Learning Goal
Create a website using Flask as the framework with a login system that stores user credentials in a database and hashes passwords.

Reflection
I was able to implement a basic login system in Flask, but it was not secure because the credentials were stored in the code directly.
I was not able to implement a login system that stores user credentials in a database and hashes passwords



Alexander (IT2o):
Personal Learning Objective:
Since we are supposed to choose an objective suitable to our project I decided to learn how to create a connection between an embedded javascript in HTML and a Python code.
Most important to me is how function call , return values and parameters work.

Reflection: 
I was partially successful in implementing my learning objective.
Function calls and return values are implemented using data formats like .json or .xml.
As a next step I want to learn how to pass parameters and how the .json or .xml files are structured.



Kayhan (IT2o):
My personal goal: Too learn more about html and get better in it!

Result: I developed a website, with a countdown, a tasklist where you can save and delete tasks, implemented a bit CSS styling and a nice background, an alert if the time goes off.

Reflexion: I learned pritty fast about html and I had a good overview on the html code, which code block does what etc.
I had my little issues with with linking the CSS with the html code. It just didnÂ´t work.



Henrik (IT2o):
My personal learning goal during this Hackathon was to get a deeper understanding of the inner workings of the Raspberry Pis and Arduinos, which I dabbled with a little but would love to do more with.
As a side note, the input for the 3d Printer made me really interested in doing more research on that topic.

Overall I'm excited to experiment more after the block, since our project we ended up on did not have the implementation, as we focused more on the development.
