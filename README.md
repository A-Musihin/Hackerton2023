As a team, we decided to address the problem of "insomnia among students". According to our findings, the problem is caused by poor self-management.

# 2.3 "Ideate" - Phase

For this phase, we created a brainwriting to find a solution to the problem. The product is on our Miro board:

As a team we decided to develop a software that will help students to work and plan tasks. For this we use the Pomodoro method.
