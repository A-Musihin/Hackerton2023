Feedbacks f√ºr unsere Problemdefinition - DIY Problem Definition Tabelle:

Feedback from Group 9 to Group 6:
- problem affects quality of education, which is good
- phrase the last argument of row 3 differently - a non flexible curriculum forces people to sleep in a forced time frame
- last two questions are not answered correctly - instead aim for mentioning the gains of a good sleep
- a different approach on this topic might be the mental health of students affecting sleep and thus quality of education
